# jant_track
## Outline
Jant_track is a digital asset management system developed for my senior studio project.<br>
It is designed to stream line collaboration over our systems network file spaces.<br>
By using a json based asset manager artists can track shot assets and easily get the latest<br>
project file updates using a QT interface.
