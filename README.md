# jantrack
## Outline
Jantrack is a digital asset management system developed for my studio project.<br>
It is designed to stream line collaboration over our systems network file spaces.<br>
By using a json based asset manager artists can track shot assets and easily get the latest<br>
project file updates using a QT interface. I have also include any additional scripts and tools<br>
that I created for our project Rider.
## Features
- Pull latest shot hip files and asset dependencies from the network
- Automate pushing shots to the render farm
- Manage assets on a per shot basis
- Version hip files locally and on the network
## Goals
- Create installation protocol
- Improve Houdini integration
- Add logging functionality
- USD implimentation
